    For every pair of nodes in a connected graph, there exists at least one shortest path between the nodes. 
    The betweenness centrality for each node is the number of these shortest paths that pass through it.

  [Algorithms.shortestPath]: `In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two or nodes in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized. 
  The problem of finding the shortest path between two intersections on a road map may be modeled as a special case of the shortest path problem in graphs, 
  where the nodes correspond to intersections and the edges correspond to road segments, each weighted by the length of the segment.`,
